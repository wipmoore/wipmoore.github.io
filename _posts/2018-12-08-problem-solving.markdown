## Overview

Summary of my notes from the books [The design of everyday things](https://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/technical/the-design-of-everyday-things,donald-a-norman-9780262525671?term=The+design) by Donald A. Norman and [How to solve it](https://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/science-mathematics/how-to-solve-it-a-new-aspect-of-mathema,george-polya-9780140124996) by George Polya.

## Models

There are three models:

- Design Model, The conceptualization the designer had.
- User Model, What the user develops to explain the operations of the system.
- System Image, The physical appearance.

The aim is to align the _user model_ and the _design model_. A user's model is formed via the system model and preconceived ideas about how the system should function so it is important that the system image convey a clear picture of the design model and that the design model is simple to conceptualize.

## Making things simple to Conceptualize 

- __Simplify the structure of the task__, minimize the amount of planning or problem solving required. 
- __Make things visible__,:
    - Allow people to know what is possible.
    - Allow people to understand what the effect of an action will be.
- __Get the mappings right__, so that users can determine: 
    - between intention and possible action.
    - action and their effect on the system.
    - actual state and perceived by sight state.
- Exploit the power of constraints.
    - Make the user feel like there is only one thing to do.
    - Plan for error
- When all else fails standardize, it is only useful if everybody knows it and adheres to it.

## Action cycle

- Form the __goal__ ( I need more light to read ).
- Form the __intention__ ( Open the blinds or turn on the light ).
- __Specify__ the actions needed to achieve the intention ( Plan if needed ).
- __Execute__ the actions.
- __Perceive__ the state of the world.
- __Interpret__ the state of the world.
- __Evaluate__ the outcome.

## Problem solving

- Understand the problem
- Create a plan of action
- Execute the plan
- Evaluate the outcome

## Notes

- For this to be useful it is kind of important that you have a good understanding of what is simple in regard to human cognition.
